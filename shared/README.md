## Shared

This directory contains shared libraries that are used over multiple Cthulhu components.


**Naming Convention Exceptions**:

Some libraries provide a equivalent `C++` and `Go` implementation; in those libraries, the `C++` name convention is adjusted to the `Go` naming convention (e.g. in `logger.go` and `logger.hpp`).
